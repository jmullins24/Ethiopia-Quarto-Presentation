<h1>Data Visualization in a Quarto Presentation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I developed graphs, interactive dashboards, and data visualizations for a non-profit organization to extract and display insights for data gathered in their medical mission trips to Sendafa, Ethiopia.
These visualizations were used in their annual presentation to hospital donors and potential volunteers at Wellspan Hospital.

I created and tracked all of these metrics from scratch. These employee dashboards are still used today in employee evaluations and annual perfomance reviews. The data directs management to identify key training points, such as increasing loan application follow through or focusing production on new construction or HELOC loans over time.
